# Zoroark's Spoilerguard

On Pokemon Showdown, the end-of-battle controls appear immediately when the battle ends. This happens right as the last turn begins to play out, before the animations have a chance to take place. Consequently, the results of a battle are often spoiled early - did I live the 50/50 damage roll? Did they dodge my Hydro Pump and get a Recover off? This extension restores the suspense of Pokemon Showdown battles by hiding the end-of-battle controls until the last turn finishes playing out.

Because the timer ticking down cannot properly be faked once a battle ends, this extension simply hides the timer while a turn is in progress. As a result, **use of this extension is not recommended for tournament play** - losing sight of the timer could put you at a disadvantage.

This has not been tested with draws by agreement, since those can only happen after 100 turns and I ain't going through that. My condolences if you get a spoiler that your opponent agreed to your draw offer mid-turn.
